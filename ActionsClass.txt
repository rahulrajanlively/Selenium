// Configure the Action
Actions act = new Actions(driver);

// To focus on element using webdriver
act.moveToElement(element).perform();

// To click on the element to focus
act.moveToElement(element).click().perform();

//drag and drop
WebElement dragElement=driver.findElement(By.id(“draggable”));
WebElement dropElement=driver.findElement(By.id(“droppable”));

  //Without dragAndDrop() method
      Action dragDrop = act.clickAndHold(dragElement).moveToElement(dropElement).build();
      dragDrop.perform();
      
//Move to Menu and then to menu option
WebElement menu = driver.findElement(By.id(“menu”));
WebElement menuoption = driver.findElement(By.id(“menuoption”));
Action subMenu= act.moveToElement(menu).moveToElement(menuoption).build();
subMenu.perform();


## ALWAYS REMEMBER TO BIULD AND PERFORM
## Builded action can be stored in an onject of action class, anf then it could be performed.
## You can build a series of actions using the Action and Actions classes. Just remember to close the series with the build() method.


Some commonly used methods:
->  clickAndHold()	= Clicks (without releasing) at the current mouse location.

->  doubleClick()	  = Performs a double-click at the current mouse location.
->  dragAndDrop(source, target)	= Performs click-and-hold at the location of the source element, moves to the location of the target element, then releases the mouse.
->  dragAndDropBy(source, x-offset, y-offset) =	Performs click-and-hold at the location of the source element, moves by a given offset, then releases the mouse.
->  keyDown(modifier_key) =	Performs a modifier key press. Does not release the modifier key - subsequent interactions may assume it's kept pressed.
->  keyUp(modifier _key)	= Performs a key release.
->  moveByOffset(x-offset, y-offset)	= Moves the mouse from its current position (or 0,0) by the given offset.
->  moveToElement(toElement)	= Moves the mouse to the middle of the element. 
->  release() =	Releases the depressed left mouse button at the current mouse location
